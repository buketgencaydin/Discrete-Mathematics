\problem{2: Hamilton Circuits}{10+10+10=30}
Determine whether there is a Hamilton circuit for each given graph (See Figure \ref{fig:G1a}, Figure \ref{fig:G1b}, Figure \ref{fig:G1c} ). If the graph has a Hamilton circuit, show the path with its vertices which gives a Hamilton circuit. If it does not, explain why no Hamilton circuit exists. \newline

\newline
Certain properties can be used to show that a graph has no Hamilton circuit. 
\begin{itemize}
		\item A graph with a vertex of degree one cannot have a Hamilton circuit, because in a Hamilton circuit, each vertex is incident with two edges in the circuit.
		\item If a vertex in the graph has degree two, then
both edges that are incident with this vertex must be part of any Hamilton circuit.
		\item When a Hamilton circuit is being constructed and this circuit has passed through a vertex,
then all remaining edges incident with this vertex, other than the two used in the circuit, can be removed from consideration. Furthermore, a Hamilton circuit cannot contain a smaller circuit within it.
	\end{itemize}
\subproblem{a} \solution\\
If we construct a Hamilton circuit with vertices a-b-c-h-g-f-e-d-a, then all remaining edges incident with these vertices, other than the two used in the circuit, can be removed from consideration. So, we need to remove b-j, h-q, f-m and d-o but this process creates a smaller circuit, such as i-j-k-p-l-m-n-o-i, within our constructed Hamilton circuit. So, there is no Hamilton circuit for the graph $G_1$ since it violates the third property. 
\newline
\subproblem{b} \solution\\
The graph has vertices of degree one: e, f and g. There is no Hamilton circuit for the graph $G_2$ since it violates the first property.
\newline
\subproblem{c} \solution\\
There is a Hamilton circuit for the graph $G_3$, such as a-b-c-f-e-i-h-g-d-a.

\problem{3: Applications on Graphs}{20}
Schedule the final exams for Math 101, Math 243, CSE 333, CSE 346, CSE 101, CSE 102, CSE 273, and CSE 211, using the fewest number of different time slots, if there are no students who are taking:
\begin{itemize}
	\item both Math 101 and CS 211,
	\item both Math 243 and CS 211,
	\item both CSE 346 and CSE 101,
	\item both CSE 346 and CSE 102,
	\item both Math 101 and Math 243,
	\item both Math 101 and CSE 333,
	\item both CSE 333 and CSE 346
\end{itemize}
but there are students in every other pair of courses together for this semester.\\ 
$\textbf{Note:}$ Assume that you have only one classroom.\\ \\
$\textit{Hint 1: Solve the problem with respect to your problem session notes.}$\\
$\textit{Hint 2: \hyperlink{https://www.draw.io/}{Check the website}}$

\newline
According to the graph above, courses which are not adjacent to each other, can have the same time slot. So, for all courses, we have these options for the same time slots:
\newline \newline
Math101: Math243, CSE333 , CSE211\newline
Math243: Math101, CSE211 \newline
CSE211: Math101, Math243\newline
CSE333: Math101, CSE346\newline
CSE346: CSE333, CSE101, CSE102\newline
CSE101: CSE346\newline
CSE102: CSE346\newline
CSE273: Nothing\newline
\newpage
As a result, CSE273 can not share any time slot. CSE333 and CSE102 are also not sharing any time slot. (Math101,Math243,CSE211) and (CSE346,CSE101) can have the same slots.

\problem{4: Applications for Hasse Diagram of Relations}{40}
Remember the Problem 3 in Homework 2. 
\newline
\newline
Write an algorithm to draw Hasse diagram of the given relations in "input.txt" which is given for HW2.
\newline
\newline
Your code should meet the following requirements, standards and accomplish the given tasks.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Read the relations from the text file "input.txt". You can use your code from HW2 if you implemented to read the file. If you didn't implement it, please check HW2 to learn how to read the relations from the file. 
	\item Determine each relation in "input.txt" whether it is reflexive, symmetric, anti-symmetric and transitive with your algorithm from HW2.
	\item In order to draw Hasse diagram, each relation must be POSET. Hence, the relation obeys the following rules:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reflexivity
		\item Anti-symmetric
		\item Transitivity 
	\end{itemize}
	If the relation is not a POSET, your algorithm is responsible to CONVERT it to POSET. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the relation is not reflexive, add new pairs to make the relation reflexive.
		\item If the relation is symmetric, remove some pairs which make the relation symmetric. For instance, if the relation has (a, b) and (b, a), remove one of them randomly.
		\item If the relation is not transitive, add new pairs which would make the relation transitive. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item After the relation becomes POSET, your algorithm should obtain Hasse diagram of the relation and write the diagram with the following format. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An example of the output format is given in "exampleoutput.txt". The file has the result of the first relation in "input.txt".
		\item In "output.txt", each new Hasse diagram starts with "n".
		\item The relation is (a, a), (a, b), (a, e), (b, b), (b, e), (c, c), (c, d), (d, d), (e, e)
		\item The relation is already a POSET so we don't need to add or remove any pairs.
		\item After "n", write the POSET in the next line as it is shown in "exampleoutput.txt".
		\item Since the relation is POSET, it becomes (a, b), (b, e), (c, d) after removing reflexive and transitive pairs. 
		\item The following lines give each pair of Hasse diagram.
	\end{itemize}	
	\item You can implement your algorithm in Python, Java, C or C++.
	\item $\textbf{Important: }$ Put comments almost for each line of your code to describe what the line is going to do. 
	\item You should put your source code file (file name is problem1.$\{.c, .java, .py, .cpp\}$) and output.txt into your homework zip file (check Course Policy).
\end{itemize}
